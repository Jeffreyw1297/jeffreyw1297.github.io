            <h2>About Me</h2>
Welcome to my website! My name is Jeffrey Wang, and I am a Cornell University undergraduate student majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am particularly interested in the aerospace sector, and I love to tinker with anything and everything! Please feel free to take a look at some of the projects I've worked on.
